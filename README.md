###
Dr. Linnes planed to have each of the members make his/her own personal info page for this webpage. This is expected to be done when all team members are decided and have the first formal meeting. And yes, it'll a huge work for me to make sub-pages for all members X﹏X
###
The personal info page is expected to be like this:

### Our Event
![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2018/02/17/9tZCGD.png)
This page is designed to be a blog for the club to publish activity photos, videos, etc. It might be a little bit annoying to make a blog with Adobe Muse. But, well, this is the only way I know to build our own blog...(ˉ▽￣～)~~
***
### Contact
![](https://s1.ax1x.com/2018/02/17/9tZPRe.png)
Viewers can send messages to the official gmail address via this page. Also they can apply for a position in the team with this page... basically just a page to send messages. 
###
After a viewer sends a message, this sub-page will show up, letting them know that the message has been received... Well, technically, sent.
